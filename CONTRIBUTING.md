## Development Workflow

### Building the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript**: All code must be properly typed
- **Tests**: Write tests for new functionality
- **Coverage**: Maintain or improve test coverage
- **Linting**: Follow existing code style

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **Error Handling**: Test error conditions and edge cases
4. **Mocking**: Use Jest mocks for external dependencies

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('Component/Feature', () => {
  describe('method/function', () => {
    it('should do something specific', () => {
      // Arrange
      const input = 'test';
      
      // Act
      const result = functionUnderTest(input);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toBe('expected');
    });
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- Focus on critical paths and edge cases
- Test both success and failure scenarios

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update tests** for your changes
2. **Run the test suite** and ensure all tests pass:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
3. **Update documentation** if needed
4. **Commit your changes** with descriptive commit messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new migration validation feature"
   ```
5. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request
